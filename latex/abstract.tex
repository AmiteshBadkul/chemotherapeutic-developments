Transition metals have an essential spot in medicinal chemistry. Research has indicated notable advancement in the utilization of transition metal complexes as drugs to treat human diseases, including but not limited to cancers, infection control, diabetes, anti-inflammatory, and neurological disorders. The transition metals are fundamental in a wide range of biological activities ranging from respiration to gene expression. These properties are what led to the exploration of the use of transition metals in anti-cancer drugs. Another reason for using transition metals is that they can easily undergo changes in their oxidation number by donating or accepting electrons. These electrons are beneficial to many biological processes.
