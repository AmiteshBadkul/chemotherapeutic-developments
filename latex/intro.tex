Cancer is among the world's most lethal diseases. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer \cite{cancerFacts}. Treating cancer is of utmost importance for saving countless lives. There currently exist three methods to treat a large variety of cancers: 1) surgical therapy -  removal of cancerous cells at initial stages of several types of cancers, 2) Chemotherapy or chemical therapy - Anti-cancer agents are used to contain the spread of the tumors, 3) radiotherapy - It destroys the cancer cells through radiation with an X-ray beam. Transition metals complexes are used as Antineoplastic agents and have been beneficial in treating cancer patients \cite{rafique2010transition}.
