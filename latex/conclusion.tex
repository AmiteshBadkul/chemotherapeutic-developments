With the progress in inorganic chemistry, transition metal complexes' role as chemotherapeutic compounds is becoming increasingly vital and relevant. Following the discovery of cisplatin, researchers have conducted a great deal of research on transition metal-based complexes' chemotherapeutic application. While these drugs have exhibited high-efficiency operating as chemotherapeutic agents for treating numerous varieties of cancers, there still exist drawbacks in using them, such as toxicity - they destroy normal cells along with infected ones, the `Drug resistance' problem, and the side effects that exist upon treatment of cancer using these complexes as drugs, the research community is even more excited than ever to work on discovering, creating new transition metal complexes, and amending existing ones to lower the toxicity, reduce the side-effects, and tackle the `Drug resistance' problem.
